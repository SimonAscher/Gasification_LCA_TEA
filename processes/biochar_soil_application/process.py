N2O Emissions from N in material
    My paper: Life cycle assessment and net present worth analysis of a community-based food waste treatment system
        - this is for digestate though - so might not be applicable

    word document 1-s2.0-S0961953415001798-mmc2 (supplementary material from the paper "Maximizing the greenhouse gas
    reductions from biomass: The role of life cycle assessment")
        - % of N applied to soil volatilised as ammonia - 40%
        - % of  N applied to soil emitted as N2O - 1%
            Note: Need to check if this is correct - maybe not applicable for biochar but rather just for fertilisers
