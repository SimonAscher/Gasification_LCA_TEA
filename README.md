# Model for the environmental and economic analysis of biomass and waste gasification schemes
A life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic analysis (TEA) (in progress) framework for the analysis of biomass and 
waste gasification schemes.

All processes have default options which the model will revert to, unless the user does specify other data.
User data is stored in 'configs/user_inputs.toml' A gui will be implemented at a later stage which will populate the 
.toml file with the specified user data.
