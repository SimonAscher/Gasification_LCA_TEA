The Jupyter Notebook file "Interpretable_ML_Gasification_Models" contains the analysis published in "Interpretable
Machine Learning to Model Biomass and Waste Gasification" (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.128062). 

An additional section has been added at the end of the file to store the developed models and conduct some further
analysis.

The folder "prediction_boundaries_and_errors" contains code used to estimate the errors in different prediction regions.
The corresponding boundaries and errors were found and stored in a pickled dataframe object.
